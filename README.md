# Quantitative Lab Notebooks
## Fundamentals of Physics I
Series of self-contained notebooks designed for first sequence calc-based undergraduate physics labs. 
* Implemented in ipython and Mathematica
* Contains:
  + Self-guided tutorial on how to perform complete experiment
  + Storage of measurement data as arrays
  + Error analysis (linear regression, curve fitting, uncertainty propogation, etc.)
  + Uses fit parameters to calculate meaningful physical quantities (e.g. friction coef., modulus of elasticity, etc.)
  + Fields for written responses (post-analysis questions, summary, etc.)
* Ten total labs, based on new experiments
* Ten prelabs, to be completed remotely
* Pre-programmed Capstone files for live measurement display
* Notebooks serve as core teaching medium to be assigned, completed, and graded

_Warning: The GitHub preview of ipython notebooks does not render embedded images appropriately. Open in Google Colabs for proper formatting._

*Note: Unfortunately, GitHub does not render Mathematica notebooks. In the future they may be viewable by hosting them as Jupyter notebooks.*
